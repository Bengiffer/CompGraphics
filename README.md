How do I approach designing software?
It may seem simple, and something I should've picked up by now, but this class got me more comfortable and familar with messing with the settings in code I write. A lot of my design process was looking at the lessons and referances and finding how they could be used or modified to work for my purpose, then following a shortcut I installed to follow a tutrial on how to apply OpenGL to my project. 

How do I approach developing programs?
Throughout the milestones for this course I think my overall process became more streamlined through sheer repitiion. I don't think I ever really had a problem eventually getting down certain practices, but this course really tested that confindence. Through sheer repition and practice I slowly became more comfortable though. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I feel a lot of what I am learning with this computer science degree will really help in my future educational pathway with the philosphy of 'code out the repition.' by having such an advanced knowledge and practice of code and computer science I will become very effective in streamlining things.
